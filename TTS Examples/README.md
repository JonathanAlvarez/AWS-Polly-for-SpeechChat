Text to speech for pepegas *only tested with Brian voice*

## You can use the following website which emulates TTS:
StreamElements API: https://www.elunduscore.com  
Streamlabs API: https://textreader.pro  

## Speed:
Speed of TTS can be modified several different ways, each involving spamming characters at the end of your message. You can use any of these characters, each one will make your text faster.  

Text|Pronunciation
:--|:--
¨¨Ï¸|Diaresis
Ç⒄⒄|Opening parenthesis 17 closing parenthesis
¨¨¸¨¨¨¸|Diaresis
⒲|Opening parenthesis w closing parenthesis

There are probably other symbols you can use as well, but these are the ones that are most used. Additionally, any repeating number such as **7777** can be used as well. 

Using capitals, you can manipulate which sentences are fast, and which are slow. 

### **Examples**:
> Hello. I. Am. Talking. Very. Slow. NOW I AM TALKING VERY FAST ¨¨¸¨¨¨¸¨¨¸¨¨¨¸¨¨¸¨¨¨¸¨¨¸¨¨¨¸¨¨¸¨¨¨¸

> HEY XQC BRIAN HERE THE POWER OF THE L_ HAS BECOME TOO POWERFUL FOR ME TO POSSESS Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄Ç⒄⒄

> 99point9percentpepega XQC YOU ARE 99point9percentpepega ¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸¨¨Ï¸

The more of these characters you put at the end of your message, the longer Brian will speak with a faster voice. Try to maximize the amount of these characters in your message.
